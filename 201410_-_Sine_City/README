Source code for "Sine City"
A JavaScript 8K intro

On Pouet: http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=64233

Notes:
	* It is likely not to work on your end.
	* Tested on Linux using Chromium and Firefox with a NVidia GPU
	* Known to work on some Windows boxes w/ native GL enabled
	* The "original" version is not the code that was shown at DemoJS,
		I adjusted quite a few things in the final, packed version.
